# UFO-Sightings

## Overview 
The Purpose of the work was to help work on Dana's web page and provide a more in-depth analysis of ufo sightings.

## Results
With this, we created a search engine to engage the number of UFO sightings in the past decade. We were able to successfully create the engine to where it filters what is requested.

## Summary
Using Javascript along with VS Code, editing the webpage was not difficult. However, the one drawback I realized in this feature was that if you removed the filter button, you had to refresh the page so it could provide you the information you wanted to search. Also in order to get back to the original table with all the data we had to refresh teh page in its entirety. I think in the future it would be good to add a button that refreshed the table instead of refreshing the whole page.
